Delphi TarLib
=============

A simple, somewhat limited tar library.

Does not read or write directly to disk.  It was written for generating and reading streams of data.  You can serialize those streams to disk easily.

Complete for reading and writing, but only ever treats contents as normal files.  This library does not handle symbolic links.


Structure
---------

The library is in the `src/` folder.

The test project is in the `test/` folder.

Metadata is in the root folder.
